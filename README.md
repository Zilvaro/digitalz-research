# Welcome!


It is critical for many businesses to share to & to collect from an information from the business partners: market info about the brands and prices, training material understanding, different technical parameters, etc. 
The designed “Tasking Module” can be used as independent engagement tool or API integrated to a company’s mobile website and demonstrates the:
  - practical app implementation for sales & marketing activities to collect some critical information about the perceived value of brands and designs
  - JavaScript implementation via:
  	- dynamic page-rendering,
  	- sign-in feature and countdown timer
  	- various data generation and visual chart display
  	- several control and notification features.


The working version of the Tasking Module mobile-web pages can be found [here](https://zilvaro.github.io/digitalz-research/).

<a name="general-rules"></a>
## 1.1 General Rules
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

While designing the functionality & user experience there were applied some guiding principles:
- 5-seconds rule: it has to be clear what the page is for in 5s (e.g. is it just for information, to sign-in or to perform an activity) and where to go next.
- forward-flow rule: even though a possibility to go back (to home page) exists, user shall move forward from every page. This is important to maintain user’s focus and interest, also to increase app’s usability by lowering # of clicks.
- consistency: every page has the same color scheme, similar structure, button design and follows a common practice of app design (OK buttons - green, main page - home, etc.).

The screen-max-width is set for 1100px to keep all the items in proportion. To keep all elements visually complete and related to each other, a light background was added that is always responsive to full screen size (not only up to 1100px).



<a name="personas"></a>
## 1.2 Personas
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

**Juan** : 22 years old active student who volunteers in different events, tries to learn new things by taking internships at multinational companies. In addition to his Facebook and Instagram accounts he would like to have an application where he can run continuous crowdfunding activities to support his studies.  

**Lilly** : 39 years old office employee that is passionate about sustainability, nice looking brands and living environment and is willing to help other people to create something fun and useful things. From time to time she is participating in different contests or opinion surveys organized by brands and communities.


<a name="color-scheme"></a>
## 1.3 Color Scheme
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

The idea of the solution is that ad-banners, product pictures or story-images will be very colorful, therefore core color scheme was chosen to be calm, cool, but not cold.

With the help of https://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/ DigitalZ has the color combination that guaranties sufficient contrast, readability and enough supporting colors to be engaging:

![color scheme](/assets/readme-assets/color-scheme.jpg)

Font-family is a standard one, that looks great on multiple browsers: **'Segoe UI', sans-serif**.

## 1.4 Structure (Flow)
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)


<a name="wireframes"></a>
### Wireframes
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

To visualize the ideas and define the priorities for the development BALSAMIQ tool was used. At first, larger (not full) site architecture was created, then prioritized what would be possible to do in a given timeframe, but already be a functional site and give a solid structure for the next upgrades.

The concept pages:

<a name="sign-in"></a>
## 2.1 Sign-in & task activation
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

To increase site's fun (gamification), several functions were used:

1. Sign in with a name to be able to continue.  We use this name to welcome personally to the app. (In real life, I would use the name of app/user initial login instead of this place). 
2. Countdown timer. It could be done between certain dates or for a set time, but I used random time between 2 & 10 minutes for the task completion. This is used lately to get a better understanding of users’ behaviour: do they answer faster under a pressure of the short timeframe or contrary, they just drop the app? This is also will be used to relate which tasks are picked-up first under time constraints.
There is no penalty here if time expires since we still want user to do something, we just notify that allocated time has already expired. 
3. Task activation. The task is not active (clickable) if the user name was not entered. After the submission, ‘click’ icons with a link appear on the task sections. 
4. 'Breadcrumbs' on some internal pages with more related content (i.e. name of the task).


DigitalZ logo from each page always returns a user to the home-page.

<a name="tasks"></a>
## 2.2 Tasks
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

Tasks section is asking the user for an opinion, insight about the brand, the market or tests his/her knowledge, for example, about training materials or working policies. It usually has rigid structure:

   - header-line that names the task (and/or topic, a company, a brand)
   - photo, reflecting the purpose or content of the text
   - task description-instructions
   - task questions that require number/radio/text input and could be supported by corresponding images
   - Submit button

![task-vitamins](/assets/readme-assets/responsive-vitamin-task500.jpg)


<a name="charts"></a>
## 2.3 Charts
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

Chart pages provide graphical representation on the Task topic. Normally, that would use the real answers, generated by multiple users, and compared with the base (average, specific market data or target). In this particular app since there is no database storage and structure, random numbers with set different intervals are generated and visualized using google-graphs.

To continue user-journey through the tasks execution, the user has 2 action options: to go to another task or exit the section.

<a name="future-features"></a>
## 2.4 Features-to-come (list is not complete)
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

Those features could be used to enhance user experience and collect more behavioral data in the future while integrating the Tasking Module into bigger solutions.

1.  Countdown timer for each task
2.	Notifications on the certain % of time elapsed
3.	Reward and status points included
4.	More information about other participants’ responses 
5.  Sharing: to allow user to share tasks with friends

## Flow Testing
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

After every significant iteration, the code was tested using Chrome Developer tools and on several devices:

- Nokia8 mobile phone
- Samsung S5e tablet
- Dell XPS 13" wide (9x16) laptop 
- Samsung 24" regular (10x16) screen monitor

Each of the pages were tested for 
1. responsiveness + smooth change from vertical to horizontal layout
2. all images and texts are clear, readable and are not distorted on different screens
3. all links to other pages work 
4. accessibility (clarity of the page and next steps)
5. code executes what it supposes to
6. the flow in general 

ALL tests PASSED.


---

There were several bugs/issues with:

 - missing images and 404 error on the published website: issues related with wrong paths assignment fixed
 - responsive design including google-charts: fixed with CSS measurements and positioning manipulations
 - some functions were not executing as expected: problems fixed by changing global variables into local
